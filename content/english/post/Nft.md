# What are NFTs 

- NFT stands for "non-fungible token"
- Compared to Bitcoins for example, an NFT is unique, with distinct characteristics and is non-interchangeable with other NFTs
- So every NFT has its value and cannot be relaced by another one
- Token here because it is a unit that be exchanged through the blockchain
- The most popular NFTs are ERC 721. In other words NFTs on the ether blockchain

# Why are NFTs revolutionary

- With the blockchain, and subsiquently NFTs, there is the concept of numerical rarity. Unlike any previous forms of numerical goods,any item on the blockchain is **unique** and can be located for the whole time the item is on the blockchain.

# Psycology behind NFTs 

*"When we have everything we need, we create value out of something that has no value"*    

* **Fungible:**(Of goods contracted for without an individual being specified), replaceable by another identical item.  

Leaving all the big grammar aside, *fungible* simply means replaceable. So as said above, *non-fungible* stands for non-replaceable. Let's take another example to illustrate this concept. Suppose you want to buy an orange jacket on Amazon for $39. There are a thousands of those same orange jackets at Amazon warehouses and even elsewhere. You don't care which particular orange jacket you are going to receive because they all have the same value to you. So this means that orange jacket has nothing special to it and it is replaceable (or fungible in our case). Now if I have this same orange jacket that I bought may be 5 years ago, it is not replaceable, in the world it is the only jacket of the sort, it has emotional value attached to it, it has significance making it non-fungible.  

Everything in the economy it one or the other. A bag of rice is fungible, whereas the Monalisa is non-fungible, there is only **1** Monalisa. This makes non-fungible items way more valuable in our economy.

* **Token:** Before explaining what this word means and how it ties to the whole NFT concept, let us see our current economy with how banks work. Suppose I, Kemtimus, wants to buy pizza from Anna, costing $6, and I use my debit/bank card for the transaction. If my bank is UBA and Anna's bank is BICEC, my bank will check if I have $6 in my account and if I do, it will validate the transaction and send the $6 to BICEC into Anna's account. So the bank here is a middleman and has as job to record every inflow and outflow of money into people's account and keep it. Now let us see the same example but in the crypto world. I still want to buy pizza from Anna but with 1BTC(bitcoins). Instead of my bank and Anna's bank keeping this record for us, in the cryto world or what it's called the blockchain, where all records are public and all those connected to it can see what happens. With my case with Anna, if I don't have 1BTC in my wallet, the public record and all those connected will see I don't have 1BTC and they will reject the transaction. On the contrary, if the amount I have is sufficient, the public record will see that the transaction can be approved because I do have the funds and now everybody on the blockchain will know I now have 0BTC and Anna has 1BTC. Instead of the pizza we now have the first ever tweet. Somebody wants to buy it for 1000BTC from me. As before, the whole public record will check if that man has enough funds to buy the tweet and if he does, the transaction is going to be approved and everybody will be aware that the man is now in possession of the tweet.  

Most NFTs are on the ethereum blockchain and all of this in mainly dependent on the hype surrounding it. Rich people have nothing more to do with their money

### Possible strategies to adopt  

As anything out there, to be profitable we need to analyze the market, what it does, in what niche we can establish ourselves and potentially what can be done to be unique. The options we have can be to either buy some NFTs at a low price and wait for the right moment to sell, or have our own collection. If we lean on creating a collection, a few ideas that comes at the top of my head can be

* Photos of unique places here in Africa(because most white men have no idea the beauties we have here)

* Unique art with our style of culture etc  

All of these ideas is to capitalise on the fact that rich people have nothing more to do with their money, they know almost nothing of Africa and we can use that at our advantage.
