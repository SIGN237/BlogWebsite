Answers to test 1 Data Structure
<!--more-->

1. Data structure is a representation of the logical relationship existing between individual elements of data.
    * Data Structure is a way of organizing all data items that considers not only the elements stored but also their relationship to each other.

    * **Destroy:** Destroy operation destroys memory space allocated for specified data structure.

    * **Selection:** Selection operation deals with accessing a particular data within a data structure.

    * **Updation:** It updates or modifies the data in the data structure.

    * **Merging:** A process of combining the data items of two different sorted list into a single sorted list.

    * **Splitting:** A process of partitioning single list to multiple list.

    * **Traversal:** A process of visiting each and every node of a list in systematic manner.

    * To put it simple, ADT is a logical description and data structure is concrete. ADT is the logical picture of the data and the operations to manipulate the component elements of the data. Data structure is the actual representation of the data during the implementation and the algorithms to manipulate the data elements. ADT is in the logical level and data structure is in the implementation level.

2. An abstract data type, sometimes abbreviated ADT, is a logical description of how we view the data
and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented. This means that we are concerned only with what data is representing and not with how it will eventually be constructed. By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an encapsulation around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the userâ€™s view. This is called information hiding. The implementation of an abstract data type, often referred to as a data structure, will require that we provide a physical view of the data using some collection of
programming constructs and primitive data types.

3. a) A stack is a linear list which allows insertion and deletion of an element at one end only.

    * b) **PUSH**, **POP** and **PEEP**

    * c) A stack is a very effective data structure for evaluating arithmetic expressions in programming languages. An arithmetic expression consists of operands and operators.

    * d)

    * g) ![Screenshot](/images/ds/5_.png)
        And last step **Reverse the postfix expression**

    * h) ![Screenshot](/images/ds/6_.png)

    * i) ![Screenshot](/images/ds/7_.png)

    * j) Not the exact question

4. a) A queue is a data structure that is best described as "first in, first out". A queue is another special kind of
list, where items are inserted at one end called the rear and deleted at the other end called the front.       
    * b) **INSERT**,**DELETE** and **DISPLAY**
    * c) Breadth first search uses a queue data structure to find an element from a graph.
