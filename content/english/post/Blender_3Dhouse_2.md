Just some notes I made while following along with this [3D modeling house blender tutorial series](https://youtu.be/MuY9hpYWVho).

- Notes below correspond to [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/MuY9hpYWVho)

- You can download a PDF copy of this post [here](www.google.com)

- You can download the associated “.blend” file [here](www.google.com). This file is the result of my work after following along with the steps in the YouTube video.

1. Press **"Shift + C"** to put the 3D-Cursor back at the center just because.

    * **"Shift + A"**, Mesh -->> Plane to add a plane.
    * **"G"** and middle mouse button to move the new plane just behind the house.

**"²"** then View selected to zoom on our new plane.

Scale it up to about this size:

Now scale it along the X-axis about this much:

* Go to Edit Mode with the plane selected.
* **"Ctrl + R"** to add some loop cuts.

**Note:** While in loop cut mode, scrolling the scroll wheel either up or down will increase the number of cuts simultaneously(which are evenly separated)
